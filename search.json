Every election, all registered voters are automatically mailed ballots to their home address roughly a month before the election. Voters then vote at their leisure and mail back or drop off their ballot sometime before the election closes. Due to concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic, many other states have implemented some version of Oregon’s voting system in preparation for the November 3rd, 2020 election next Tuesday.\nAt the end, before switching slides, ask: “What data would be useful to answer this question?

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nUnder construction until the first lab.\n\n\n\n\nClass Format\nThis is an in-person class with three lectures each week and one two-hour lab led by a GSI. This class is designed assuming you’ll be in class. Attendance is not part of your grade. If you miss class, you’ll be able to find most materials from class - slides, snippets of code - published on the course wesite.\n\nGroup tutoring\nTutors will offer group tutoring sessions several times each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. You’re welcome to attend any session that works well for your schedule. Check the Office Hours page to see the group tutoring schedule.\nGroup tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.\n\n\nOffice Hours\nOffice hours are an opportunity to chat one-on-one with your instructor and GSIs. Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. We’re happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind! Please check the Office Hours page to see the times of the various office hour/group tutoring sessions.\n\n\nDon’t come to class if you’re sick!\nMaintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\nSupplementary textbooks\nYour primary reference throughout the course will be the notes that you take in class but there are also several terrific books that are free and online that can expand your knowledge.\n\nAdvanced R, Hadley Wickham\nR for Data Science, Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund\nR packages, Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan\n\n\n\nComputational tools\nEach student will need a laptop in order to engage with the computing aspects of this class. Throughout the semester you’ll be installing several different software tools, all of which are free. We will be mainly using the computing and programming environment R (via RStudio) to analyze data in this class. We will also ask you to use a command line interface to interact with your operating system. You do need your own computer to use R and do the assignments. No need to install these ahead of time; we’ll guide you through how to get set up.\nAbout half of the students in 133 have some coding experience in Python or R and about half do not. For those who come from Data 8 or some previous coding experience in python, the first labs will help you transfer that knowledge over to R. Both languages are excellent platforms for analyzing data, are widely used in data science, and have their individual strengths. R has been developed within the statistics community specifically for data analysis, while python is a general-purpose programming language but has large data analysis capabilities.\n\n\n\nCourse communication\n\nbCourses\nWe don’t use bCourses for much. It is primarily used to disseminate important announcements for the entire class such as the initial welcome announcement, final exam information etc.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nThe official discussion forum for the class will be hosted on Ed. Ed is a forum to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It’s a useful resource for learning from your peers and seeking help from tutors and instructors.\nIf you have a question about the material or assignments (or anything related to the course), create a new post to ask your question on Ed. If it is about something personal, then mark it as “private”, and only course staff will be able to see your post. This is the best way to contact us if you have a personal concern, as it ensures the fastest response. If your question does not include personal information and can be answered by other students, make sure it is public.\nIn a course this large, the instructors have a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please use the class forum or visit office hours if you wish to contact us.\n\n\n\nAssignments, Exams, and Grading\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets provide you with essential practice on the ideas and techniques discussed in class.\n\n\nTurning-in assignments\nYou will be turning in your assignments on a platform called Pensieve, the younger sibling of Gradescope. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work. Note that regrade requests will need to be submitted by a deadline, which will usually be about a week the grades are released.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are open ended assignments assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English using complete sentences. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually while some will be turned in as group assignments. Usually Part 1 of each lab will be a group submission (this means that the entire group turns in only one submission), and Part 2 of the lab (the part with coding) will be an individual submission. For all group submissions, the maximum size will be 3.\nLabs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it! Again, please follow the formatting instructions so that you don’t unnecessarily lose points.\nLabs are assessed for correctness.\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor.\nThere is both an individual and group component to each quiz.\nThe individual component will last about 40 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes with your name in the upper right-hand corner, which you will turn in along with your group quiz. The group component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last about 25 minutes. Your final (composite) quiz grade will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores.\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam will be held in person during finals week. The time and date is Wednesday December 17th, 7 - 10 pm.\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade in this class is, to the best of our ability, a measure of your understanding of the concepts of computing with data.\n\nProblem Sets: 5%\nQuizzes: 50%\nLabs: 25%\nFinal: 30%\n\nThe grades will not be curved (&gt; 90% is some kind of A, etc.).\nIn order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester we will drop everyone’s lowest quiz grade before calculating your quiz average at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nStat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodation from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.\n\n\nLate Work\nNo late assignments will be accepted.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nYou are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on worksheets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.\nResearchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.\nThe general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.\nThe following examples of collaboration are allowed and in fact encouraged!\n\nDiscussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.\nShowing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.\nPosting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.\nHelping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.\nGoogling the text of an error message.\nCopying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.\nAsking chatGPT or a similar tool for help with a coding error, or help understanding concepts. Note that you will need to cite this use, and if the solution is wrong, you will lose credit.\n\nThe following examples are not allowed. In fact, many of the behaviors described below will hinder your learning experience, rather than enhance it:\n\nLeaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.\nAccessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.\nGoogling for complete problem solutions.\nPosting questions into chatGPT or similar tools, and copying and pasting the output in your solution.\nWorking on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.\nSubmitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.\n\nIf you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.\n\nViolations of the collaboration policy\nThe integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.\nStudents determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.\nAnd again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I do if I’m on the waitlist?\nAttend both lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as one two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.\nAre class sessions recorded?\nNo. Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.\nIs attendance required?\nNo, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another. This class is very unique in that regard.\nIf you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.\nAre time conflicts allowed?\n\nStat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?\nIf you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up assignments.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.\n\n\n\nCampus Resources\nIf you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.\nWith regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.\n\nAs UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"
